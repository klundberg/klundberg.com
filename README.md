My personal site.

If you're just looking to read my blog, you probably want to go [here](http://www.klundberg.com).

However, if you want to see how the sausage is made, you're in the right place. This site built on top of the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) by Michael Rose, with some customizations by me.
