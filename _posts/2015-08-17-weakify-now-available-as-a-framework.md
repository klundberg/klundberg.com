Yesterday I decided to collect my [weakify]({% post_url 2015-04-15-capturing-objects-weakly-in-instance-method-references-in-swift %}) functions (that i've been tweaking since that post a bit for some new use cases I've discovered) into a framework that can be installed via [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) or [carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) (or manually if that's your thing). You can find the project (which has been given an extensive readme, [Quick-based](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) unit tests, and documentation comments) on GitHub [here](https://github.com/klundberg/Weakify). If you've been using these functions at all, this should give you a better way to keep up to date with any changes you might be interested in.

I do plan to update these soon for Swift 2 support (in case any throwing versions might be necessary). Enjoy!
