I decided this week to release the `CopyOnWrite` type I finished up in the [last post]({% post_url 2017-01-21-encapsulating-value-semantics-part-3 %}) I wrote on the subject. You can get at it via all the popular ways to integrate swift libraries, including CocoaPods, Carthage, and Swift Package Manager. Since the library itself is small and fits nicely into one file, you can also just copy and paste it easily into your own project as long as you adhere to the MIT license that the code is licensed under.

If you want to check it out or help contribute, you can find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/klundberg/CopyOnWrite). Enjoy!
