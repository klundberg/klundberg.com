Welcome to my site. In the coming weeks I plan to post about various programming topics related to things I'm working on and learning. I'll likely focus a lot on Swift and Apple's development platforms since that's the area I'm very interested in currently. I may also get personal and talk on other topics tangentially related (or even unrelated) to programming but those will probably be few and far between. I hope you'll enjoy what you read!
